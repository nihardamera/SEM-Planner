    prompt = f"""Act as a senior Google Ads specialist organizing a new search campaign given a list of high-potential keywords for a brand.
Group the keywords into 5-7 distinct, tightly themed ad groups using logical segmentation. Each group should have a concise name and a list of related keywords.
The segmentation strategy should follow established best practices, creating distinct ad groups for different types of user intent:
- Brand Terms: Ad groups dedicated to keywords that include the brand's own name . These typically have the highest conversion rates and should be isolated to track their performance accurately.
- Category/Generic Terms: These ad groups target broader product or service categories. They are crucial for attracting new customers who are not yet familiar with the brand.
- Competitor Terms: A more aggressive strategy involves creating ad groups that bid on competitors' brand names. This can be effective for capturing market share from users who are close to making a purchase decision.
- Location-Based Queries: For businesses with a physical presence or geographically-specific services, targeting location-based queries can be effective.
- Long-Tail/Informational Queries: These ad groups target longer, more specific, often question-based keywords. While lower in volume, they capture users in the research phase and can be targeted with content-driven landing pages.
Guidelines:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object where keys are ad group names and values are lists of keywords
- Do not include any explanatory text, just the JSON
- Group similar keywords together logically
- Use descriptive ad group names

Keywords to group: {keywords}

Example format:
{{"Brand Terms": ["keyword1", "keyword2"], "Product Category": ["keyword3", "keyword4"]}}"""
